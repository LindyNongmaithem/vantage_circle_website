## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher) or yarn
- Angular CLI (v15 or higher)

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Angular CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli@15
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

4. **Open Browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`

### Build for Production

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Usage

## Assumptions Made

1. **Employee IDs**: Generated automatically using a combination of timestamp and random string
2. **Date Format**: Dates are stored as ISO strings (YYYY-MM-DD) and displayed in medium date format
3. **Sample Data**: The application initializes with 3 sample employees if localStorage is empty
4. **Email Uniqueness**: The application does not enforce unique email addresses (can be added if needed)
5. **Department List**: Fixed list of departments (HR, Engineering, Sales, Marketing, Finance, Operations)
6. **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with LocalStorage support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Code Quality Features

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with interfaces and types
- **Modular Architecture**: Separated concerns (components, services, models)
- **Reactive Programming**: Uses RxJS Observables for data flow
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation with custom validators
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for localStorage operations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS media queries
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and proper form labels
- **Clean Code**: Well-organized, readable, and maintainable code structure

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add pagination for large employee lists
- Implement email uniqueness validation
- Add employee photo upload
- Add more filter options (date range, etc.)
- Implement undo/redo functionality
- Add employee statistics/charts
- Implement role-based access control
- Add import from CSV functionality
